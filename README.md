# If icons doesn't show up correctly
Fura Mono Regular Nerd Font is included in this repo. However feel free to use any other!
After you have installed the font you need to change your terminal's default font.

# Lazygit
```sudo install lazygit /usr/local/bin```

# RipGrep
You need this! Beleive me! This tool is the ultimate searching tool. You need it.
```sudo apt-get install ./ripgrep_13.0.0_amd64.deb```

# Clipboard
If copying and pasting is not working out of the box then you probably need to install something like xclip.
```sudo apt-get install xclip```
